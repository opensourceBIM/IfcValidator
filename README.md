IfcValidator
==========

This is a BIMserver plugin that checks Ifc2x3tc1 models for common requirements.

> Note: This plugin needs BIMserver 1.5

The plugin generates [Extended Data](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver/wiki/Extended-Data) according to the following [Validation Report](https://github.com/opensourceBIM/BIMserver-Repository/wiki/Validation-Report) format.

For now, this plugin only implements checks that can be done with only the IFC file, so it will not read external files for cross-checking data.

## TODO
- Implement for IFC4 as well

## Checks

A list of checks that have been identified by asking people from the building industry and reading Dutch "norm" documents that seem computer checkable.

## Further explanations

### Geometric ratios

This check uses the geometry of an object to check whether the right IFC type has been used. For example, IfcSlab objects are usually flat surfaces that ware much wider then they are high. Columns are usually slender compared to their length etc...

To be able to do these kind of comparisons it would be very useful to have oriented bounding boxes available (those are not available in BImserver at the moment).
